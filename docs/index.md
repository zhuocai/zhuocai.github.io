I am currently an MPhil student in Computer Science and Engineering in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My supervisor is [Amir Goharshady](https://www.goharshady.com). I am interested in theoretical computer science, especially in blockchain, cryptography and game theory. 

Before coming to HKUST, I received my Bechalor's degree in Automation from Tsinghua University.
